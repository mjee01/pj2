                    <p>These days, it was no longer a question of whether Noel was nice or not nice— he was sure of this. He worked hard to serve his peers after being elected as class president, tutored others while working on his own exams. Rather, he questioned whether his own actions and gentle words truly came from the heart. The question of his authenticity had always lingered in the back of his mind. It wasn’t until much later, during the summer after his 2rd year in high school, that the answer surfaced. </p>
                    <p>School had hardly gotten out of session when their summer bucket list plans were dashed. That day, the two of them stood in the school parking lot for an impromptu meeting. It was the midpoint between their homes. Leon, still panting from the bike ride there, had answered the impatient call at short notice.</p>
                    <p> Noel couldn’t wait a second longer. There was important news:</p>

                        <p> “I killed a person yesterday,” he told Leon. </p>

                            <p>The panting stopped all at once, as if the wind was sucked straight out of his lungs. Noel took a moment to enjoy his best friend’s shocked face. He wanted to laugh at the expression, all wide eyes and mouth slightly parted. The brilliance of the sun lit up the amusing expression in a perfect spotlight. His hair, ghostly blonde— stuck up in a mess of flyaways, nearly translucent. The boy would’ve thrown a fit if it had been pointed out. It made Noel want to smile. He probably wasn’t a nice person after all. </p>
                            <p>Noel thought little of what he’d said as he watched Leon’s trembling figure, the shouts of “You’re lying” louder than his own voice. But Noel looked right into his friend’s eyes, the way he did when he retold stories or fabricated them. Even if he had been lying, there was no way to discern it. He told Leon about the one he killed. About the last day of school, when he’d gone to their classroom to pick up his things. How, while picking up his history textbook, he’d been alone with the other student. In one quiet moment, the year of tolerating the classmate was deemed useless. Noel saw it all, from the subtle shoulder-checks in the hallway to the web of rumors, to direct belittlement and fulfilled threats. But there was no way the classmate would’ve seen the push coming, with Noel’s smile and the noncommittal responses to the years-long harassment. </p>
                            <p>Leon’s lips were pulled thin, having grown quiet. As if he was remembering their many makeshift checkups after school, the sting of ointment and clumsy bandages. He clenched his hand into a fist, as if to steady his fingertips. He’d always looked visibly sick at the sight of mere bruising, weak to the sight of purple-blue welts. Noel saved the morbid details of the killing. He said that it all happened in a blur; he was shoving with the weight of his core before he could notice the iridescent quality of the glass. It was too late before Noel saw the fragility of the vase of lilies on the desk. The soft light filtering through the window. Nor did he see the petals on the floor, his pure resentment louder than the thuds of the body tumbling down the stairs. </p>

                            <p>By the last words of Noel’s story, Leon looked uncharacteristically solemn.</p>

                        <p>Though they were the same age, he seemed too young in Noel’s eyes to be forming that sort of hilariously grim expression. It was akin to a kid who had learned what it meant to go to heaven, dumbfounded by the severity. His bike was thrown off to the side, long forgotten.</p>
                        <p>“I don’t think I can stay here anymore,” Noel announced to the audience of one in the empty lot. “So I’m going somewhere far away to die.” </p>
                        <p>His own melodramatic declaration sounded childish to his own ears. A reminder of how small children fled in hopes that their mothers would run after them. That upon return, they’d receive the concern they desired. Noel, though, knew better than to hope for these things. He would never return.</p>

                        <p>“I have grandparents in the countryside, I think I’ll stay there until it’s time,” Noel mused with an easy smile, eyeing the disheveled strands of bleached hair. </p>
                       <p>Fists clenched, Leon’s wavering gaze searched for recognition in his friend’s bluff. After a moment, he reserved himself to staring at their beat-up sneakers. Such an obvious scaredy-cat.</p>
                        <p>“It’s a pretty peaceful--”</p>
                       <p>“Take me with you, then,” Leon said, gaze suddenly full of resolve. More of a statement than a request.</p>

It was silly to imagine he’d need an extra sleeping shirt wherever they were going. He’d been teased before by Noel, but not like this. </p>
